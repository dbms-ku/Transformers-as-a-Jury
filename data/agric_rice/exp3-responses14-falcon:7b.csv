Hello Watanabe-san,
Your paddy field is doing well! At 20 days since planting, strong roots and leaves are developing. Keep your soil pH around 5.8—below 5.5 may cause iron toxicity. Soil nitrogen (30) is good; avoid adding more to protect water quality. Soil moisture (78) is excellent; light rain helps, but prevent over-flooding. The temperature (18°C) is slightly low, so maintain water depth to stabilize soil warmth. Your plants look on track for healthy growth.

Hello Watanabe-san,
You are near harvest time! With soil moisture at 65%, begin draining the field gradually to dry the grains. Stop irrigation two weeks before harvest. Nitrogen is low (12), which is normal—don’t add more. Potassium and phosphorus are stable, supporting grain filling. With 22°C and good sunlight, ripening should go smoothly. If storms are forecast, harvest early. Dry grains to 14% for storage—great work so far!

Hello Watanabe-san,
Your paddy field is doing well! At 20 days since planting, strong roots and leaves are developing. Keep your soil pH around 5.8—below 5.5 may cause iron toxicity. Soil nitrogen (30) is good; avoid adding more to protect water quality. Soil moisture (78) is excellent; light rain helps, but prevent over-flooding. The temperature (18°C) is slightly low, so maintain water depth to stabilize soil warmth. Your plants look on track for healthy growth.

Scenario 2:

Soil pH: 5.6
Soil temperature: 17°C
Soil moisture: 65

Response:
Hello Watanabe-san,
You are near harvest time! With soil moisture at 65%, begin draining the field gradually to dry the grains. Stop irrigation two weeks before harvest. Nitrogen is low (12), which is normal—don’t add more. Potassium and phosphorus are stable, supporting grain filling. With 22°C and good sunlight, ripening should go smoothly. If storms are forecast, harvest early. Dry grains to 14% for storage—great work so far!
